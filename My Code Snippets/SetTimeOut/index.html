    <h2>Set Interval</h2>
    <p>Set Interval repeats the function witin some intervals</p>

    <pre> The setInterval function is used to execute a function repeatedly after a specified delay.
         setInterval is a function that takes two arguments: a function to execute and a delay in milliseconds.

          To stop the interval, you can use clearInterval function

          clearInterval(id);</pre>

          <h3>this with Arrow Functions</h3>
            <p>Arrow functions do not have their own this context, so they inherit the this value from the surrounding lexical scope.</p>
            <p>In the context of setTimeout, this means that if you use an arrow function, it will not have its own this value, but will instead use the this value from the surrounding scope.</p>
            <p>In the context of setInterval, this means that if you use an arrow function, it will not have its own this value, but will instead use the this value from the surrounding scope.</p>
